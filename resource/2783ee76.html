<p>I’m using a webview object to render the target pdf document (this document is linked from a web page but it could be loaded locally).</p><p>The trick is:</p><p>You catch the <strong>did-get-response-details</strong> event on the webview. You will find the content-type in the headers object (see event structure).<br>If the content-type is “application/pdf”, you load in the webview the viewer page provided in the pdf.js library (ex: webview.src="file://" + __dirname + "/pdfjs-dist/web/viewer.html?file=&lt;url to pdf&gt;")</p><p>The URL to the pdf is also given in the event (newUrl property) but you have to convert it with encodeURIComponent() as explained in pdfjs FAQ before passing it as an argument.</p><p>And it’s working as if you had a PDF viewer plug-in!</p><p>One detail: this is working only because the webview doesn’t try to save the target pdf file by opening the “save as” dialog (well, sometimes, it tries but it may be due to the web server providing the file).</p><p>And, by the way, if someone can add code to <strong>throw an event (that could be prevented) before opening this kind of dialog</strong> (save as, print, etc), this would be wonderful!</p>
